<p class="fs-3">This game was made using unity & was written in C#.
<br>
    The game was made in only a few weeks and sees the player trying to keep their fish alive while being able to purchase more fish as well as food.
<br>
    I made everything seen in the video.

             <p class="fs-3">             
                There wasn't a lot of game design work that needed to be done for this project as it was all layed out for me in the GDD I was given.
                I did however make a handfull of decisions that impacted the feel of the project.
                One of the biggest is the decision not to pause the game while you're buying stuff as it adds to the frantic nature of trying to keep your fish alive.
                I tried to spawn enemy fish far away from any of your own fish, to offset some of the stress and balance the difficulty.
