    This game was made using unity & was written in C#.

    This is a ditched prototype for a stealth game about copying game elements and using them to hide, enemies were however never implemented.

    Everything shown was developed by me.

             <p class="fs-3">             
                While only a prototype, the intended design for the game was meant to encourage experimentation, by making most in game objects part of the player's arsenal.
                I decided on only allowing one copy to be held at a time, so the player would have to keep in mind at which angles they would still be able to see the oblect they wanted to copy.
