        <h3>Hi, my name is Kevin Steevens.
            <br>
Iâ€™m a 4th year software development student and I'm mostly focussed on game development.
<br>
I was born on 18/07/2003 and was born and raised in the Netherlands.
<br>
<br>
I have a huge affection for the art of game design and have basic knowledge about C#, html and css.
The reason I wanted to get into game development is, because I was fascinated by the complicated puzzle like structure we know as video game design.
Video games have been my primary hobby since I was little, so making videogames felt like the logical next step.
